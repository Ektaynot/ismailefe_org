* Ä°smail Efe's Blog Site

This site is the representation of myself on the internet. I post my thoughts and experiments on here. My main goals are making useful/educational content and putting my thoughts into the world.

I avoid using javascript as much as possible. That's why I only have javascript [[https://ismailefe.org/photography/analog_photos/][on my Photos Page]], which only adds the ability to expand the photos. The site works perfectly fine without it.

The main css file is in /templates/style.css, I occasionally use extra css files which are mostly on the same page as the index file.

src/ directory contains .org files which are the original files I write to. The .org files get exported to html and then get manually placed to the corresponding folders.
