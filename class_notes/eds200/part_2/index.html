<p>Good teachers know their subjects well but it is not enough, the most
effective teachers combine content knowledge with knowledge of teaching
and with knowledge of their students.</p>
<p>Knowledge of pedoagogy and of learners allows the teacher to select
and implement instructional alternatives that can best address
students's misconceptions. Thus effective teachers should have knowledge
of the subject, and how best to help the individual students in their
classes come to understand it appropriately.</p>
<h1
id="professional-skills-and-abilities-of-effective-teachers.---w8">Professional
skills and abilities of effective teachers. - W8</h1>
<p>Effective teachers possess a repertoire of professional skills that

<ul>
<li>Provides the context for the lesson</li>
<li><strong>Should:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hook students' interest</li>
<li>Establish a favorable / encouraging environment</li>
<li>Make students aware of the topics, objectives and tasks for the
lesson</li>
<li>Relate the previous lessons to the current lesson</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The beginning of a lesson is important because it establishes a tone
for the lesson</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Using Variety</li>

<h2 id="using-instructional-time-effectively">Using Instructional Time
Effectively</h2>
<ol>
<li>Optimizing time
<ul>
<li><strong>Time on task:</strong> The amount of time students actively
engaged in academic tasks
<ul>
<li>The more time students spend actively engaged in academic tasks, the
more they learn</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Mandated Time:</strong> Formal time scheduled for school
(the length of the school year)</li>
<li><strong>Allocated Time:</strong> Amount of mandated time intended
solely for academic activities</li>
<li><strong>Academic Instruction Time:</strong> Amount of allocated time
during which the teacher is conducting instructional activities</li>
<li><strong>Academic Learning Time:</strong> Amount of time a given
student spends actively engaged in academic tasks.</li>
<li>If the student does not pay attention or is inaccurately learning
the content: it is not academic learning time</li>
<li>Effective teachers are the ones who decrease the difference between
the mandated time and academic learning time</li>
<li><strong>Tips:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Begin and end on time</li>
<li>Establish rules and routines</li>
<li>Actively monitor students' engagement</li>
<li>Create a highly interactive &amp; varied enviroment that gets
students' attention and hold it throughout the lesson</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Although the allotted time may appear sufficient, various tasks such
as attendance tracking, distributing papers, providing feedback, and
other administrative responsibilities consume a significant portion of
your time, resulting in reduced academic instruction time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintaining the momentum is important, it helps maximize academic
learning time by maintaining an instructional pace.
<ul>
<li>Momentum must be adapted to students' needs</li>
<li>Generally, teacher-directed instruction allows greater control over
momentum and instructional time</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Transitions are points where students' attention is re-focused to
new topics or activities
<ul>
<li>Teachers should plan for and implement smooth transitions, they
should minimize the number and the length of these transitions and
should make them organized as possible.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conduction-interactive-lessons">Conducting Interactive
Lessons</h2>

<li>Using questions</li>
<p>Questioning involves not only asking good questions
but also knowing how to obtain answers and how to react to students'
responses</p>

natural, unambiguous language &amp; should vary in form &amp; in
cognitive level</li>
<li>The teachers need to ask one question at a time</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Teachers ask more &amp; better questions when they include them in
their lesson plan</li>
<li><strong>Waiting time:</strong> pause after asking questions and
before reacting to the students' answers (3-5 seconds)</li>
<li>Ask questions to all students, not only volunteers (to keep the
class alert!)</li>
<li>After a student responds to a question, the teacher's reaction is
critical (Following up)
<ul>
<li><strong>Probling:</strong> Additional questions</li>
<li><strong>Redirecting:</strong> Asking the same question to another
student</li>
<li><strong>Repharasing:</strong> Rewording a word to make it clear
(should be avoided!)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Providing Clear Instruction
<ul>
<li><strong>Instructional clarity:</strong> Teachers' ability to provide
instruction that helps students come to a clear and accurate
understanding of important concepts or ideas</li>
<li>Explaining the content correctly &amp; ability to structure the
presentations
<ul>
<li><strong>Logical organization:</strong> Informing students of the
lesson objectives early in the lesson and presenting the content so that
students can see the relationship between concepts and ideas</li>
<li><strong>Identifying &amp; reinforcing main points:</strong> Noting
&amp; reporting major points and writing them on the board; repeating;
reviews, and summaries</li>
<li><strong>Using good examples to elaborate:</strong> Concrete, verbal,
or written examples (non- examples)</li>

<h1 id="what-is-morality---w11">What is morality? - W11</h1>
<ul>
<li>The attempt to define what is right and wrong about our actions and
thoughts, and what is good and bad about our being who we are.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="what-is-the-difference-between-ethics-and-morals---w11">What is
the difference between ethics and morals? - W11</h1>
<ul>
<li>Ethics is a branch philosophy that questions what is right or
wrong.</li>
<li>Although morality and ethics are used interchangeably, they are not
same
<ul>
<li>Morals are individual's own principles regarding right and
wrong</li>
<li>Ethics are rules provided by an external source like professional
ethic codes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li>A lawyer‚Äôs morals may tell her that murder is reprehensible and that
murderers should be punished, but her ethics as a professional lawyer,
require her to defend her client to the best of her abilities, even if
she knows that the client is guilty.</li>
<li>In most parts of the world, a doctor may not euthanize a patient,
even at the patient's request, as per ethical standards for health
professionals. However, the same doctor may personally believe in a
patient's right to die, as per the doctor's own morality.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="ethics-in-teaching-profession">Ethics in teaching
profession</h1>
<ul>
<li>All professions needs ethical codes</li>
<li>Teachers needs them too, you cannot become an effective teacher
without ethical consideration because many of the effective teachers
attributions and professional skills intercept with ethical standards
like credibility, flexibility, fairness.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-issue-of-ethics-in-teaching">The issue of ethics in
teaching:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The teacher's role, perceived as a morally neutral profession,
strengthens the status and prestige of teaching in society; however, it
extends beyond imparting subject mastery for future occupations to also
encompass fostering the moral development of students as individuals and
citizens in a democratic society.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-ethics-affects-teaching">Why ethics affects teaching</h2>
<p>Teachers are necessarily assuming that certain forms of development
are better than others, that certain behaviors are worth enhancing, that
certain personality traits are important to develop, that certain
capacities are more valuable, that certain standards of achievement</p>
<ul>
<li>Teachers are responsible for preparing ‚Äúgood citizens‚Äù who are fit
to participate in an organized civic community (enculturation of the
young)</li>
<li>Teaching decisions ‚Äì whether to teach one way rather than another,
to emphasize one skill at the expense of another skill, to punish or not
to punish ‚Äì usually involve ethical decisions and evaluating what is
right or wrong/good or bad/worthy or unworthy</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="ethical-values---w11">Ethical Values - W11</h1>
<h2 id="virtue-based-approach">Virtue-based approach</h2>
<ul>
<li>This approach seeks to define what makes a good persona rather than
what makes an action morally right</li>
<li>Teachers' personal character are critical as they are responsible
for the personal &amp; moral development of students, therefore virtues
are important</li>
<li>Virtues defined for Turkish Education System
<ol>
<li>Justice</li>
<li>Friendship</li>
<li>Honesty</li>
<li>Self-control</li>
<li>Patience</li>
<li>Respect</li>

<li>Responsibility</li>
<li>Love of nation</li>
<li>Helpfulness</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="duty-based-approach">Duty-based approach</h2>
<ul>
<li>Teachers' decisions or behavior are judged as moral or immoral</li>
<li>One example is the adherence to principles of academic integrity is
valued in itself even if it leads to negative consequences</li>
<li>Another example is if learning was achieved by means of cheating or
plagiarism, this is judged unethical</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="outcome-based-approach">Outcome-based approach</h2>
<p>This approach judges actions in terms of their positive or negative
consequences</p>
<ul>
<li>Utilitarianism states that a morally right action is one that
produces good for everybody to enjoy
<ul>
<li>The most good to the greatest number of people and the least harm to
the fewest number of people.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="applying-ethics-in-teaching">Applying ethics in teaching</h2>
<p>Ethical code is the standards of knowledge, skills, behavior, and how
to make reasoned judgments in the framework of teaching as a
credentialized profession.</p>
<ul>
<li>Teachers' role is nurturing many aspects of children's welfare,
transmitting culture, preparing for civic life, and providing means to
life, <u>all of which involve ethical issues and dilemmas.</u></li>
<li>The literature fails to show how ethical values are put into
teaching.</li>
<li>The teaching profession does not have a formalized community or a
