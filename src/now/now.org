* When did I last update this page
- Sep 6, 2025

* What am I doing?
- I am currently in ƒ∞zmir, I came here to join [[https://dilbilim.deu.edu.tr/conference-information/][ICTL22]], which is a conference on Turkish Linguistics. The conference ended today. It was a wonderful experience. I watched a bunch of great presentations. Hope to join the 23rd one with my own research. I hope to return to Kocaeli on the 8th. I will spend my last two days exploring the urban environment of ƒ∞zmir.
- I am also taking lots of pictures. To be honest, I am having a really hard time capturing the soul of urban ƒ∞zmir. I have a couple of shots I plan to share. You can see them in a couple of days on my [[https://glass.photo/efe][glass page]] and [[https://unsplash.com/@ismailefetop][unsplash page]].
- Lately my professional work has consisted of web development and video editing. While development is going well, editing is really taking a toll on me.

* What am I planning on doing?
- When I go back to Kocaeli, things are going to be a bit busy. I will spend two weeks there before going back to university. I have to balance work and family/friend time.
- Course selections will start at the end of the month. I have to do proper preparation because I have to take 4 must courses, 1 departmental elective, 1 non-departmental elective, and 2 must courses for my minor. All 8 classes must be scheduled at different times, with no overlaps.
- I want to start running again. I am waiting for going back into uni to start because there are no proper tracks for running where I live.
