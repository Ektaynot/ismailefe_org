I have a very structured file management system for my university life. I save almost everything and everything that I saved has a place. Let's start with the main folder.

* Uni Folder
I have a folder called 'uni' in my icloud drive. This folder sync between my macbook and iphone. This allows me to access my PDFs and docs with ease from either of my devices. I have a shortcut to this folder on my ~(home) directory. Here is what this folder looks like on the first level.

#+begin_src
uni
├── citation
├── current-course -> /Users/ismailefetop/uni/first_year/02/
├── etc
├── first_year
└── prep
#+end_src

- Citation folder houses my [[https://www.zotero.org/][zotero]] bookmarks. I use an [[https://github.com/andras-simonyi/citeproc-el][Emacs extension]] which allows me to cite those bookmarks.
- Current course folder is a shortcut to my current semester.
- etc folder houses stuff that are necessary but aren't specific enough for a folder.
- first_year and prep are for categorizing years in my university life.

* Semester folders
Every year houses 2 semester folders inside it. Because my classes changes every semester it is the easiest way to categorize my classes. *For example:*

#+begin_src
first_year
├── 01
└── 02
#+end_src

Let's look at the first semester of my first year. This is the first level.

#+begin_src
01
├── ceit100
├── eds200
├── fle134
├── fle137
├── fle147
├── hist2201
├── school.org
├── todo.org
└── turk103
#+end_src

Every class has it's own folder. I will talk about them more in the next section.
** school.org
This file is my semester's guidebook. It houses my class schedule, the classrooms, and shortcuts to class folders. It uses [[https://orgmode.org][org mode]], which is similar to [[https://www.markdownguide.org/][markdown]] but more powerful.

** todo.org
I use [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Capture.html][org capture]], which allow me to write quick todo items when writing stuff in Emacs. These todo bits go into this file.

* Class Folders
These folders are the meat and bones of my setup. They hold everything about that particular class and they do it in /style/. For example let's look at my eds200 folder.

#+begin_src
eds200
├── eds200.org
├── homeworks
├── notes
└── odtuclass
#+end_src

** eds200.org
Every class folder has an org file with that classes name. It houses information such as the instructor's name, email address and their office hours. It also have quick access to folders.

** homeworks folder
Every homework related thing goes into this folder and every homework has it's own folder.

** notes folder
I divide homeworks by week. I write notes in org and these org files go into appropriate week folder.

** odtuclass folder
My university uses it's own [[https://moodle.org/][moodle]]. Our instructors communicate and give homework to us through there. It is also divided by week and the stuff our instructors upload goes into those folders.

* Conclusion
It might seem overly complicated at first, but once you get used to it, it's very easy to operate. It's definitely better than looking for that one file you downloaded weeks ago. And you don't need to know any complicated computer stuff to use this system. _Even though org files are plain text files._ You can just change the org files with more common text files.

* Sidenote
Creating this folder structure might be cumbersome, so I created this python script to ease the process.

#+begin_src python
import os

class_list = ['ba100',
              'hist2202',
              'fle129',
              'fle200',
              'fle280',
              'fle480',
              'turk104',
              'eng102']

year = 'first_year/'

semester = '02/'

system_path = '/Users/ismailefetop/uni/' + year + semester

# overwriting an exisiting folder might create problems, so the code doesn't do anything if the wanted semester folder exist.
if os.path.exists(system_path) == True:
    print('This directory already exists.')
    quit()

os.makedirs(system_path, exist_ok=True)

with open(system_path + 'school.org', 'w') as fp:
    pass

with open(system_path + 'todo.org', 'w') as fp:
    pass

for class_name in class_list:
    class_name_folder = system_path + class_name + '/'
    os.makedirs(class_name_folder, exist_ok=True)
    os.makedirs(class_name_folder + 'odtuclass/', exist_ok=True)
    os.makedirs(class_name_folder + 'odtuclass/misc/', exist_ok=True)
    os.makedirs(class_name_folder + 'notes/', exist_ok=True)
    os.makedirs(class_name_folder + 'homeworks/', exist_ok=True)

    with open(class_name_folder + f'{class_name}.org', 'w') as fp:
        pass
