I use a lot of apps that allow me to use custom themes. While most people who are into customizing their setup like to choose one theme, I like different themes for different apps. Here are the themes I use.

* Lighthaus
 * [[https://lighthaustheme.com/][Lighthaus Website]]

I use this theme for [[https://bear.app/][Bear]]. It's real easy on the eyes and complements the bear font.

* Mountain
 * [[https://github.com/mountain-theme/Mountain][Mountain Repo]]

This theme is used for the [[https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/][kitty terminal]]. I've been trying different themes for kitty for about 4 years. Mountain is by far the best.

* Ros√© Pine
 * [[https://rosepinetheme.com/][Ros√© Pine Website]]

There are tons of options for [[https://code.visualstudio.com/][vs-code]]. Ros√© Pine is really polished and looks great, nothing to complain.

* Kanagawa
 * [[https://github.com/meritamen/emacs-kanagawa-theme/blob/master/kanagawa-theme.el][Kanagawa Repo]]

I saved the best for last, this is an Emacs theme inspired by the colors of the famous painting by Katsushika Hokusai. I really love this theme, the colors are perfect for reading and writing. It might not work this well for programming but luckily I don't use Emacs for that.
