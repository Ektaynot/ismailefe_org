<h1 id="foundations-of-education">Foundations of Education</h1>
<p>Changes in educational foundations does not happen because of their
merits but because of the majority (often a narrow one) of educational
decision makers.</p>
<p>Some subjects generally considered to be among the foundations of
education include the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>History of education</strong>: Present school patterns
can be traced back to important historic needs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Philosophy of education</strong>: Differences in
educational philosophies may result in conflicts about educational
decisions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sociology of education</strong>: Through formal
education, teachers are charged with transmitting elements of cultural
elements for the young.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Educational psychology</strong>: Educational
psychologists ,who study how young people learn, don't agree on how to
organize and present content in schools. Some emphasize learners'
development patterns and suggest that certain learning experiences
should wait until learners reach specific maturation levels. Others
argue that maturation isn't a reliable predictor of what content young
people can learn. Arguments like this are commonplace as psychologists
clash about different subjects often.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Educational curriculum and instruction</strong>: The
curriculum is an overall operational plan for a school program. What
goes on each day in the classroom is instruction.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Legal subjects in education</strong>: Includes such
issues as state and local financial support and standard for
teachers.</p></li>

educational values of the school district in which you teach.</p>

science and technology, new methods of processing and storing
information, and new methods of defining or organizing fields of
study.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Beliefs about the nature of the learner:</strong> New
theories about the learning process, may also produce changes in
educational theories and purposes.</p></li>
