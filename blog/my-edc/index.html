<h1 id="what-is-edc">What is EDC?</h1>
<p>EDC stands for every day carry, encompassing everything from your
wallet and phone to various types of screwdrivers can be included in the
EDC category.</p>
<p>Even though everyone carries some stuff with them, there are people
that take great pride in their EDC. We can find those people in <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EDC/">forums</a> and <a
href="https://youtu.be/BQJyHHBkFPg?si=Xt-NkxlRHMklMiXL">youtube</a>
videos. Those places can be a great starting point for people who want
to give a little more effort to what they carry.</p>
<h1 id="my-edc">My EDC</h1>
<p>While mine might seem a little lacking and boring, it has been by far
the most efficient setup for me.</p>
<p>I will mostly write about the interesting stuff and give only the
bare minimum for the normal stuff.</p>
<h2 id="emoji">📱</h2>
<p>I am using an iPhone, while the operating system is quite locked I
love the polished iOS experience and the great ecosystem which I am a
part of.</p>
<h2 id="emoji">🎧</h2>
<p>I am using the airpods pro 2nd gen. While expensive, they sound great
and switching between my phone and my computer is stupid easy. Not
having to deal with the unwanted small stuff and focusing on my creative
projects is really important to me. Being in the apple ecosystem allows
me to do that.</p>
<h2 id="emoji">⌚️</h2>
<p>I am using an old apple watch. I like tracking my sleep and exercises
so that I can make adjustments. Also, seeing notifications without
looking at my phone really comes in handy more than you might think.</p>
<h2 id="emoji">🪪</h2>
<p>Like most people, I used a lot of different wallets. My biggest
problem with my old wallets were they size. Because of my different
circumstances I need to carry lots of cards and photos with me. For my
old wallets to carry those different cards they needed to be really
bulky. I wanted a slim option, so I found the <a

I can stuff a lot and not have to worry about them being lost. I carry
the ones I frequently use in the front pockets. It really is the perfect
wallet for me.</p>
<h2 id="emoji">🔑</h2>
<p>I carry the keys for my dormitory, nothing special.</p>
<h1 id="my-backpack">My Backpack</h1>
<p>I like to use different bags in my backpack. That way nothing is lost
inside my bag. I have a computer case with a big zipper pocket, a travel
pouch, and an umbrella.</p>
<h2 id="emoji">🎒</h2>
<p>My backpack is a mid-size Herschel Little America. Because I carry my
backpack everywhere, it needs to be light and comfortable. This bag is
just that. It has no fancy trick. Just a light and small backpack. It's
the perfect size for carry it everyday.</p>
<h2 id="emoji">💻</h2>
<p>This is probably the most important part of my life. I take notes for
class, I program on it, I watch youtube. Basically most of my digital
life is on here. I have a mba(2022) with 16 gigs of ram and 512 gigs of
storage. I am coming from a linux laptop, It used to have 3 hours of
battery use and the linux system would broke a couple of times a month.
MacOS has the hackability of linux and it is crazy stable. I can easily
say that this laptop suits my needs perfectly.</p>
<h2 id="emoji">💼</h2>
<p>While the most important use-case of my computer case is protecting
my computer, it also holds a lot of important accessory like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logitech pebble</li>
<li>70W USB-C Power Adapter</li>
<li>One Magsafe Cable</li>
<li>One Lighting Cable</li>
<li>a Baseus Presentation Remote</li>
<li>a Generic Type-C Hub</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="emoji">👝</h2>
<p>I also have a vintage travel pouch. On one side I have a usb power
adapter and a 3 headed power cable and on the other I have a small
notebook and different pens. On the outer shell I house different kinds
of medicines.</p>
