For me, there is only one answer to "What do you want to be?".

*I want to be content.*

I want to be content with what I do for a living, I want to be content with where I reside, and more importantly, I want to be content with *who I am*.

While I do have specific plans for my future, in the end, nothing else matters if I am not content.

I can't find *true fulfillment* in material things; it has to come from the work I put in. I have to work diligently, I have to always take the long road, and build myself with blood, sweat, and tears. So that I can cherish everything I have, as I will know for sure that they were deserved.

I also have to build my surroundings. *We are reflections of our friends.* That means I have to look up to and be proud of people whom I call friends. A fellow blogger, [[https://marcel.io/about][Marcel]], has a great blog post called "[[https://marcel.io/posts/life-affirming-choices][Life-Affirming Choices]]". In that blog post, he says

#+HTML: <blockquote>
/"I want to be, and surround myself with, people who are willing to put in the effort to live a life their future selves will thank them for‚Äîpeople who make scalable, life-affirming choices because they know these actions grow and compound over time, leading to greater, unexpected benefits."/
#+HTML: </blockquote>

I recommend checking out his post as he has been a great inspiration for this.

While I am proud and happy with everything I've achieved up until now, I also know my *potential*. I know that I can do great things that can change the world for the better, and I want to live up to it.

#+HTML: <br>

*In the end, our life is too fleeting not to do great things.*
