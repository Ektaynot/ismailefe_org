    <ul>
      <li>I came back to Kocaeli. Living a peaceful life.</li>
      <li>
        My lab and faculty projects have been really active lately, that's why
        I've been doing a lot of remote work.
      </li>
      <li>
        I usually do my remote work from home, but I occasionally go to Kadıköy
        to work. My favorite cafe, Walter's, is there and doing remote work from
        a cafe brings variety to my work life.
      </li>
      <li>
        Going to Kadıköy and Moda is a lot of fun. There are tons of vegan
        restaurants and great sights to photograph. There are also a lot of
        culture activities, but I am not attending them as much as I want.
      </li>
      <li>
        I started to go to the cinema again. There is a chain cinema that is in
        walking distance. They usually show old classic movies in addition to
        new releases.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1 id="what-am-i-planning-on-doing">What am I planning on doing?</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I want to finish the final project I am doing for the faculty. It will
        take around 1 week. I have to work in a virtual machine for this project
        and the sluggishness is really getting to me. But it's coming together
        really nicely. I am proud of the work me and the team has put in.
      </li>
      <li>I plan to visit Mersin and İzmir this summer.</li>
    </ul>

      I also have a page dedicated to my old Now pages. You can check it out
