      <h1 class="title">5 Life Lessons</h1>
      <p class="author">İsmail Efe Top</p>
      <p class="date">2024-09-14</p>
    </header>
    <p>
      I’ve been reflecting on life for the past couple of months, and my world
      view has changed a lot. I feel like I have grown as a person, and I wanted
      to share the lessons I’ve learned during this time and throughout my life.
      <strong>Here are 5 life lessons from a 20-year-old.</strong>
    </p>
    <h1 id="calling-an-ambulance">Calling an ambulance</h1>
    <p>
      A lot of people my age tend to question if calling an ambulance is the
      right thing to when faced with health and emergency situations. I can
      understand the reasoning, as these kinds of situations are almost always
      in gray areas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is a simple trick if you want to decide if you should call an
      ambulance; <strong>call 911</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the situation escalates into you thinking you might need an ambulance,
      that's all the reason you need. Even if you think the situation might be
      minor and you think you might waste a first responders time, you should
      call. Because this is what first responders are for and you won't waste
      anyone's time.
    </p>
    <p>911 operators are trained professionals and will know what to do.</p>
    <p>
      In the worst-case scenario, where you call 911 and an ambulance isn’t
      necessary, they will connect you to a medical professional who can guide
      you on what to do next and also will advise you to call again if the
      situation worsens.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, worst case scenario, if you don't call 911, is the situation
      escalating and <strong>someone dying</strong>.
    </p>
    <h1 id="fake-it-till-you-make-it-is-a-powerful-weapon">
      "Fake it till you make it" is a powerful weapon
    </h1>
    <p>
      We humans tend to think the worst of situations. We feel like we are not
      good enough, feel like we don't have what it takes, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      And we act accordingly to this. Whether in a work or a school setting, we
      find ourselves in situations where we don't want to speak up or step on
      anyone's toes.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also feel like we are not good enough to achieve our dreams. Hell,
      sometimes we don't even dare to dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best way to shake of this mindset is to fake your ideal mindset into
      existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my opinion, while hard and sometimes cringe, it is the best way to deal
      with low self-confidence and self-worth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of yourself as your ideal self, work hard, speak your mind on
      things, and dream big. Even if you are faking it and are well aware of the
      fact, with time, it will turn into reality.
    </p>
    <h1 id="books-textbooks-and-youtube-videos">
      Books, textbooks, and YouTube videos
    </h1>
    <p>Let's say that you want to learn about investing;</p>
    <p>
      Introduction to investing books or textbooks are
      <strong>10 times slower</strong> than watching a YouTube video.
    </p>
    <p>But… they are <strong>100 times</strong> more effective.</p>
    <p>
      Let me explain, if you are not watching an actual university lecture. What
      you are watching is a fast-paced tutorial that tries to cram as much as
      possible into the shortest possible amount of time.
    </p>
    <p>In these kinds of videos…</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You are not able or encouraged to take notes because of it's fast-paced
        nature.
      </li>
      <li>Rewinding is always a bother.</li>
      <li>
        And because you are not taking the lesson at your own pace, your brain
        doesn't want to absorb it.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      And don't get me started on how distracting it is to learn something in
      YouTube where entertainment is one click away and everything else is one
      tab away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, reading about something can be really slow. But because you are the
      one deciding the pace, your brain has an easier time absorbing the
      information.
    </p>
    <p>
      If buying books are becoming too expensive or cumbersome, investing in a
      nice e-book reader might be a great idea.
    </p>
    <h1 id="the-only-person-you-can-truly-depend-upon-you">
      The only person you can truly depend upon: You
    </h1>
    <p>
      Family and friends are one of the most important things in the world. You
      should love, cherish, and trust them. But you can't lean on them for all
      situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      There will be times where you need or have to go through something on your
      own. These challenges tend to be hardest and being prepared is important.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always work and invest in yourself. People can die, material things can
      perish. The only person you can depend on is you. Because if you are no
      more, then all is done.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also think that life has a lot more meaning when you work on yourself
      regularly. When you eat healthy, read, exercise, or do anything that helps
      you become a better person. You feel like you are more in control and the
      things that cannot be changed becomes more bearable.
    </p>
    <h1 id="the-only-metric-of-success-happiness">
      The only metric of success: happiness
    </h1>
    <p>
      Until this year, I thought that success would come in the form of money or
      fame. But it turns out I was extremely wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Money doesn't mean anything if you are not happy. Fame doesn't mean
      anything if you are not happy. Career advancement doesn't mean anything if
      you are not happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, you don't have to be happy constantly. But if you have all the
      things above and you don't feel any happiness, what is the point?
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone would choose being a happy person in a cheap car than be a sad
      person in a Porsche.
    </p>
    <p>
      If material things bring you happiness go for it. If traveling brings you
      happiness travel. If being alone and doing your own thing brings you
      happiness do that. Also, you don't have to do these things right now. Even
      dreaming about these is a lot of fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my opinion, having the people you love nearby, working on your goals
      and self, and having the insight to recognize what truly matters in life
      is the key to happiness and living a content life.
