      <h1 class="title">Why Use Emacs?</h1>

    </header>
    <p>
      This article is about my relationship with Emacs as a 20 year old college
      student. First of all, Emacs is a text editor that has been around for a
      really long time, 48 years to be exact. It still gets updated regularly
      and has a thriving community that continuously grows. The main selling
      point of Emacs is how extensible it is. You can change any of it's part
      using
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp?useskin=vector"
        >Emacs Lisp</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is all you need to know to read this article as I will talk about all
      of this in detail.
    </p>
    <br />
    <div style="max-width: fit-content; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">
      <img
        src="/blog/why_use_emacs/ivy.png"
        width="250px"
        alt="A drawing of an ivy."
      />
    </div>

    <p>
      I envy people who can just pick up a tool and start using it right away
      without the constant need to perfect it. Small imperfections distract me,
      and my mind sways away to solve it. This usually prevents me from getting
      work done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up until 2022, I would start writing something in a random text editor,
      notice a behavior I wanted to change or disable, search it for a few
      minutes on how to change it, change it (if it were possible), and repeat
      this cycle every 20 minutes. A couple days later, I would find an
      unchangeable behavior that is a deal-breaker and try to find a new text
      editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      This continued until I started considering Emacs as a serious solution to
      my needs. I learned the existence of Emacs in 2019 thanks to a
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8koAgkBEnM">DistroTube video</a
      >. After a few months, I tried
      <a href="https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs">Doom Emacs</a>, a kind of
      a starter-pack config, and couldn't see the point of using it as I didn't
      need anything other than a simple code editor at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2022, for reasons I sadly do not remember, I gave Doom Emacs another
      try. This time was a lot better. My university lessons were getting
      serious and I needed a way to take notes efficiently and distribute them
      as I needed. As an added bonus I was really deep into vim motions and Doom
      Emacs was built around
      <a href="https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil">evil-mode</a>, which
      "emulates the main features of Vim".
    </p>
    <p>
      It took me around a year to get completely comfortable and I no longer
      feel the need to tweak
      <a href="https://github.com/ektaynot/doom">my config</a> frequently. But I
      should note that learning Emacs is a journey with no end. Every day I
      learn something new about Emacs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Firstly, I want to give a brief explanation to what Emacs is for me, then
      talk about the limitations, and finally list the reasons why I like it so
      much.
    </p>
    <p>
      For me, Emacs is a text editor that is infinitely extendable,
      keyboard-driven, modular, and immortal. It's basically a bunch of elisp
      file taped together. The best part is you can tape your own elisp code
      easily and it works as though it was always there. There is no "Emacs
      talks to your elisp code", your code is Emacs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emacs can easily be the best text editor, coding environment, or a
      Frankenstein that adapts to your workflow. For example, I turned Emacs
      into the ultimate writing environment that spellchecks, organizes, and
      converts my notes into beautiful word documents with custom styling or
      functional sites with html and css code bundled.
    </p>
    <h1 id="limitations">Limitations</h1>
    <p>
      Before I get into more about the reasons I use it, I want to talk about
      it's limitations.
    </p>
    <h2 id="learning-curve">Learning curve</h2>
    <p>
      For most people, Emacs won't be perfect out of the box. There will be tons
      of stuff that won't work for you. And to change those things you will need
      to read a lot of documentations, discussions, and github issues. Lisp is a
      foreign language for most people and learning such an alien language for
      customizing a text editor might be too much. Even if you don't mind
      tackling a new language, investing such a big time might be a deal-breaker
      for some.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a lot of good videos, documentation, etc. But the main issue is
      how much time it takes to perfect it. Because the options are endless,
      there are a lot of cool stuff you can do and you find yourself taken away
      by your creativity to execute those ideas. I have lots of cool functions
      that do bunch of useful things, which I will talk about them in the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't get me wrong, it definitely pays of exponentially. But if you are in
      the middle of a busy school year or you are working a really busy job, I
      would recommend you to start learning it when you have a time off.
    </p>
    <h2 id="things-breaking">Things breaking</h2>
    <p>
      Things sadly break a lot when you are a beginner. Most of the time it
      turns out the be your fault and you have a general idea of how to solve
      it. The worst is when an update breaks things. This usually happens when
      you install a lot of third-party packages. There are times when you don't
      know what caused the issue and there are times that even if you know what
      caused the issue, you don't know how to fix it. This rarely happens, but
      really sucks when it does.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lot of the breakage goes away or becomes really minor when you have
      experience. But sadly, even the most seasoned among us experience these
      things.
    </p>
    <h2 id="not-great-to-use-on-mobile">Not great to use on mobile</h2>
    <p>
      While nobody codes on their phone seriously, a lot of people take notes on
      their phone. Emacs has a wonderful mode called
      <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org</a>. Org-mode is awesome for
      note-taking, schedule managing, and literate programming. I will get into
      more detail later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wanting to access your shopping list or any other note is important. And
      accessing them from your phone is not the best. While there are tons of
      org-mode apps for android and a couple for iOS, you can only do so much.
      Creating a system that works for you with small stuff is possible if you
      invest enough time but I personally gave up and use
      <a href="https://bear.app">Bear</a> for quick notes and to-do's.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to try using org notes in mobile, I would recommend
      <a href="https://www.orgzly.com/">orgzly</a> for Android and
      <a href="https://plainorg.com/">Plain Org</a> for iOS.
    </p>
    <h1 id="why-use-it">Why use it</h1>
    <p>
      Now comes the fun part. Talking about the positives and what makes Emacs
      unique.
    </p>
    <h2 id="flexibility">Flexibility</h2>
    <p>
      You can change a lot of things and I am not talking about changing
      appearance or ability to add extensions. Almost everything in Emacs is a
      function in an Elisp file.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are also major and minor modes that activate according to the buffer
      you are on. You can combine modes together and create powerful workflows.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can write functions or packages that talks to core Emacs functions and
      write anything you can imagine.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using Vim or Neovim, there are some restriction that come from your
      terminal emulator. But because Emacs is a GUI application, you can have a
      greater control. For example, I like my text editor to look minimalistic
      as much as possible. To achieve this, I disabled line numbers, titlebar
      decoration, highlighting of the current line, and much more.
    </p>
    <p>Here is the final result:</p>
    <img
      src="/blog/why_use_emacs/emacs.webp"
      alt="An image of my Emacs window."
    />

    <p>
      In most editors, to change a core functionality, you have to write a
      package that needs to follow a large set of guidelines and have bunch of
      formalities. In Emacs you only need an elisp file and load that file at
      startup. Nothing else.
    </p>
    <h2 id="org">Org</h2>
    <p>
      Org mode is
      <strong
        >"A GNU Emacs major mode for keeping notes, authoring documents,
        computational notebooks, literate programming, maintaining to-do lists,
        planning projects, and more — in a fast and effective plain text
        system."</strong
      >
      -<a href="https://orgmode.org">orgmode.org</a>
    </p>
    <p>This is a good introduction but I think I can expand more upon this.</p>
    <p>
      Org documents are plain-text files that end with '.org'. Org can be used
      as a markup language like
      <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/">Markdown</a>, but
      using it just as a markup language would be a bit wasteful. Org can help
      you organize your life with
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BOiRmjw5aU">org-agenda</a>, can
      be an interactive programming notebook like
      <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>, can help you do literate
      programming with org blocks, and can replace apps such as Microsoft Word,
      Microsoft PowerPoint, Mail, Calendar, and much more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that we have a general explanation, I can talk about my personal
      use-case for Org.
    </p>
    <h3 id="writing-class-notes-and-blog-posts">
      Writing class notes and blog posts
    </h3>
    <p>
      Org has the habit of gently pushing you the way of correct note-taking. I
      know that there is not a single correct way to take notes but I think the
      default Org behaviors are a pretty general guideline to how you should
      take notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took notes in Org for two semesters. These two semesters I had tons of
      different classes and mostly used Org in two ways: taking notes while the
      teacher speaks and writing long essays about different topics at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks to how Org forces you to act in a certain way, the notes I take
      during classes comes out nicely structured and has no need to do
      post-cleaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thanks to my Org related functions, I am able to write long essays
      without leaving Emacs.
    </p>
    <h3 id="exporting">Exporting</h3>
    <p>
      The ability to turn your .org files into .docx, .pdf, and .html files
      effortlessly might be my favorite functionality. If you give a little bit
      more effort, you can even export with a custom style-sheet. I have a
      <a href="https://ismailefe.org/blog/my_org_pandoc_workflow/"
        >whole post</a
      >
      talking about this.
    </p>
    <h3 id="literate-programming">Literate Programming</h3>
    <p>
      While I love the idea of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming"
        >Literate Programming</a
      >, I don't practice it except for one occasion; my
      <a href="https://github.com/ektaynot/doom">Doom Emacs config</a>. Having a
      config that explains itself is a godsend for both other people and future
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can write notes, add links, and create test areas in an Org file and
      make it tangle to a proper config file automatically at every save.
    </p>
    <h3 id="packages-i-use-for-org">Packages I use for Org</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          I use <a href="https://github.com/kawabata/ox-pandoc">ox-pandoc</a>,

            >org-pandoc-import</a
          >
          for exporting.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          I use
          <a href="https://github.com/andras-simonyi/citeproc-el">citeproc</a>
          and <a href="https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref">org-ref</a> for
          biblio. I configured <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">zotero</a> to
          auto export my bib files and these packages read from those file. So,
          I can easily add citations and end-texts to my Org documents.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          I use

            >org-auto-tangle</a
          >
          for tangling my config.org file.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="evil-mode">Evil-mode</h2>
    <p>
      I mentioned evil-mode in the beginning but I can't emphasize how important
      it is for me. I have the complete power of vim inside Emacs. I can create

      evil-mode, I would have probably give up learning Emacs.

    <h2 id="my-custom-functions">My custom functions</h2>
    <p>
      I have tons of functions that are mostly written by me and ChatGPT. Emacs
      community doesn't really condone the use of AI in general but I recommend
      the use of AI to beginners with the condition that they should question
      and research the output. AI can be dumb and give you bad code. Always ask
      for it to break down the output and validate the end result yourself while
      looking at documentation. After a certain point you should be able to
      write small functions and then you don't have to ask AI for a whole
      function but just help with small parts. I think this is the best way to
      approach learning elisp to configure Emacs. Here is a list of my most-used
      functions. -You can see the code in

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>efe/google-current-word:</strong> This is a function that
          googles the word at point and opens it in your default browser. I use
          this when I encounter a new concept or when I misspell a word so hard
          that only Google knows what I mean.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>efe/first-result-url:</strong> Gives the word at point to a
          script called
          <a
            href="https://gist.github.com/Ektaynot/46681539aa1c030b3a58986e7f3df397"
            >firstresult</a
          >. This in turn copies the first result from a google search. Really
          useful when you want to create a hyperlink and need a link to the
          github repo or the official website without opening your browser.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>efe/tureng-(turkish/english):</strong>
          <a href="https://tureng.com/tr/turkce-ingilizce">Tureng</a> is a
          community driven dictionary. I use this function to look at different
          meanings of a word. It displays 10 different meanings in the echo area
          and goes away when you press anything. Sadly, I can't share how I get
          the results as it may or may not breach the user agreement.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>efe/open(-project)-in-vscode:</strong> Pretty
          self-explanatory, either opens the file or the project in VS Code. It
          uses the doom-modeline–project-root variable, so the function might
          not work in vanilla Emacs.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

      Thanks for reading my Emacs propaganda. I love this program so much that I
      feel the constant need to talk about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I really feel like everyone can benefit from using Emacs. It just takes
      time a long time to be efficient in it.
