<h1 id="what-is-edc">What is EDC?</h1>
<p>
      EDC stands for every day carry, encompassing everything from your wallet
      and phone to various types of screwdrivers can be included in the EDC
      category.
    </p>
<p>
      Even though everyone carries some stuff with them, there are people that
      take great pride in their EDC. We can find those people in
      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EDC/">forums</a> and
      <a href="https://youtu.be/BQJyHHBkFPg?si=Xt-NkxlRHMklMiXL">youtube</a>
      videos. Those places can be a great starting point for people who want to
      give a little more effort to what they carry.
    </p>
<h1 id="my-edc">My EDC</h1>
<p>
      While mine might seem a little lacking and boring, it has been by far the
      most efficient setup for me.
    </p>
<p>
      I will mostly write about the interesting stuff and give only the bare
      minimum for the normal stuff.
    </p>
<h2 id="emoji">üì±</h2>
<p>
      I am using an iPhone, while the operating system is quite locked I love
      the polished iOS experience and the great ecosystem which I am a part of.
    </p>
<h2 id="emoji">üéß</h2>
<p>
      I am using the airpods pro 2nd gen. While expensive, they sound great and
      switching between my phone and my computer is stupid easy. Not having to
      deal with the unwanted small stuff and focusing on my creative projects is
      really important to me. Being in the apple ecosystem allows me to do that.
    </p>
<h2 id="emoji">‚åöÔ∏è</h2>
<p>
      I am using an old apple watch. I like tracking my sleep and exercises so
      that I can make adjustments. Also, seeing notifications without looking at
      my phone really comes in handy more than you might think.
    </p>
<h2 id="emoji">ü™™</h2>
<p>
      Like most people, I used a lot of different wallets. My biggest problem
      with my old wallets were they size. Because of my different circumstances
      I need to carry lots of cards and photos with me. For my old wallets to
      carry those different cards they needed to be really bulky. I wanted a
      slim option, so I found the
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Front-Pocket-Wallet-Zippers-Minimalist/dp/B0C77NS29R">OneTigris</a>. I can stuff a lot and not have to worry about them being lost. I carry
      the ones I frequently use in the front pockets. It really is the perfect
      wallet for me.
    </p>
<h2 id="emoji">üîë</h2>
<p>I carry the keys for my dormitory, nothing special.</p>
<h1 id="my-backpack">My Backpack</h1>
<p>
      I like to use different bags in my backpack. That way nothing is lost
      inside my bag. I have a computer case with a big zipper pocket, a travel
      pouch, and an umbrella.
    </p>
<h2 id="emoji">üéí</h2>
<p>
      My backpack is a mid-size Herschel Little America. Because I carry my
      backpack everywhere, it needs to be light and comfortable. This bag is
      just that. It has no fancy trick. Just a light and small backpack. It's
      the perfect size for carry it everyday.
    </p>
<h2 id="emoji">üíª</h2>
<p>
      This is probably the most important part of my life. I take notes for
      class, I program on it, I watch youtube. Basically most of my digital life
      is on here. I have a mba(2022) with 16 gigs of ram and 512 gigs of
      storage. I am coming from a linux laptop, It used to have 3 hours of
      battery use and the linux system would broke a couple of times a month.
      MacOS has the hackability of linux and it is crazy stable. I can easily
      say that this laptop suits my needs perfectly.
    </p>
<h2 id="emoji">üíº</h2>
<p>
      While the most important use-case of my computer case is protecting my
      computer, it also holds a lot of important accessory like:
    </p>
<ul>
<li>Logitech pebble</li>
<li>70W USB-C Power Adapter</li>
<li>One Magsafe Cable</li>
<li>One Lighting Cable</li>
<li>a Baseus Presentation Remote</li>
<li>a Generic Type-C Hub</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="emoji">üëù</h2>
<p>
      I also have a vintage travel pouch. On one side I have a usb power adapter
      and a 3 headed power cable and on the other I have a small notebook and
      different pens. On the outer shell I house different kinds of medicines.

  <title>My Emacs Eye Candy</title>

<h1 class="title">My Emacs Eye Candy</h1>
<p class="author"><a href="mailto:ismailefetop@gmail.com">ƒ∞smail Efe Top</a></p>
<p class="date">2024-01-14</p>
</header>
<p>First of all, this post is directly inspired by <a href="https://xenodium.com/my-emacs-eye-candy/">√Ålvaro's</a> work. I
love his stuff and he has been a great inspiration for me. I suggest
everyone to check out his stuff.</p>
<img src="eye_candy.png"/>
<p>In this post I am planning to walk you through my visual <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> setup, I will use
the <a href="https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs">Doom Framework</a>.
I am planning on making a detail blog post about Emacs, <a href="https://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a> and how I use them, because of
this I will not go into explanation of what Emacs is. There are great
sources about Emacs and org-mode on youtube. Until I make that post, you
can explore the Emacs world freely.</p>
<p><strong>Let's Start</strong></p>
<h1 id="install-brew">Installing Homebrew</h1>
<p>I will be using <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> to install Emacs
and it's dependencies.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" data-org-language="sh" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb1-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">/bin/bash</span> <span class="at">-c</span> <span class="st">"</span><span class="va">$(</span><span class="ex">curl</span> <span class="at">-fsSL</span> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh<span class="va">)</span><span class="st">"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h1 id="install-emacs">Installing Emacs</h1>
<p>I am choosing the default cask for Emacs. I tried several different forks of
mac Emacs but all of them gave me poor performance on my m2 macbook.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" data-org-language="sh" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb2-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">brew</span> install <span class="at">--cask</span> emacs</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>After installing do not start Emacs.</strong> Starting Emacs
will create a profile, which will conflict with your doom
profile.</p>
<h1 id="install-doom">Installing Doom</h1>
<p>Doom is a stable framework for Emacs. You can considered like a base
config file. It really makes Emacs usable out-of-box.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" data-org-language="sh" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb3-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> clone <span class="at">--depth</span> 1 https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs ~/.config/emacs</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb3-2" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">~/.config/emacs/bin/doom</span> install</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And now we are ready to hack our Emacs.</p>
<h1 id="changing-the-theme">Changing the theme</h1>
<p>I used to use the doom-dracula theme. But nowadays my favorite is the
<a href="https://github.com/meritamen/emacs-kanagawa-theme">kanagawa
theme</a>.</p>
<p>Add the below line to ~/.config/doom/package.el</p>
<div class="sourceCode" data-org-language="emacs-lisp" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode commonlisp"><code class="sourceCode commonlisp"><span id="cb4-1"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb4-1" tabindex="-1"></a>(package! kanagawa-theme)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then set your theme to kanagawa, for this put the below line in your config file ~/.config/doom/config.el</p>
<div class="sourceCode" data-org-language="emacs-lisp" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode commonlisp"><code class="sourceCode commonlisp"><span id="cb5-1"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb5-1" tabindex="-1"></a>(<span class="kw">setq</span> doom-theme <span class="dt">'kanagawa</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><b>Note:</b> From now on all the code should go into your config file.</p>
<h1 id="changing-the-font">Changing the font</h1>
<p>I like using the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/">JetBrains Mono</a>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" data-org-language="emacs-lisp" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode commonlisp"><code class="sourceCode commonlisp"><span id="cb6-1"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb6-1" tabindex="-1"></a>(<span class="kw">setq</span> doom-font (font-spec :family <span class="st">"JetBrains Mono"</span> :size <span class="dv">22</span>))</span></code></pre></div>
<h1 id="enable-word-count">Enabling Word Count</h1>
<p>This puts a word count in the modeline.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" data-org-language="emacs-lisp" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode commonlisp"><code class="sourceCode commonlisp"><span id="cb7-1"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb7-1" tabindex="-1"></a>(<span class="kw">setq</span> doom-modeline-enable-word-count <span class="kw">t</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<h1 id="disable-hl-line-mode">Disabling hl-line-mode</h1>
<p>'hl-line' makes the current line a different color. I don't like
it.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" data-org-language="emacs-lisp" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode commonlisp"><code class="sourceCode commonlisp"><span id="cb8-1"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb8-1" tabindex="-1"></a>(remove-hook <span class="dt">'doom-first-buffer-hook</span> <span class="op">#'</span>global-hl-line-mode)</span></code></pre></div>
<h1 id="the-title-bar">The title bar</h1>
<p>I like the look of an empty unified title-bar, so this removes the
text. <strong>Only works for mac.</strong></p>
<div class="sourceCode" data-org-language="emacs-lisp" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode commonlisp"><code class="sourceCode commonlisp"><span id="cb9-1"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb9-1" tabindex="-1"></a>(<span class="kw">setq</span> ns-use-proxy-icon <span class="kw">nil</span>)</span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb9-2" tabindex="-1"></a>(<span class="kw">setq</span> frame-title-format <span class="kw">nil</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<h1 id="remove-the-tilde-signs">Removing the tilde signs</h1>
<p>There is an ugly tilde sign on empty lines by default. I really don't
like it. You can remove it by commenting out the 'vi-tilde-fringe' line
in ~/.config/doom/init.el</p>
<h1 id="olivetti-mode">Olivetti Mode</h1>
<p>There is a melpa package called <a href="https://github.com/rnkn/olivetti">olivetti</a>. This package
provides a good look for writing/reading by decreasing the width of the
buffer.</p>
<p>You can install Olivetti by adding the below line to
~/.config/doom/package.el</p>
<div class="sourceCode" data-org-language="emacs-lisp" id="cb10"><pre class="sourceCode commonlisp"><code class="sourceCode commonlisp"><span id="cb10-1"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb10-1" tabindex="-1"></a>(package! olivetti)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can adjust the width like this</p>
<div class="sourceCode" data-org-language="emacs-lisp" id="cb11"><pre class="sourceCode commonlisp"><code class="sourceCode commonlisp"><span id="cb11-1"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb11-1" tabindex="-1"></a>(<span class="kw">setq</span> olivetti-body-width <span class="dv">94</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<h1 id="reading-mode">Reading Mode</h1>
<p>When writing or reading I like a couple of things different. I like
to open up olivetti, disable the line numbers and the modeline. This
function allows me to change these settings in one go. Also I have an
undo function. I have them set to '√∂' and '√ß' as those keys are not used
for any commands.</p>
<p><strong>Reading Function:</strong></p>
<div class="sourceCode" data-org-language="emacs-lisp" id="cb12"><pre class="sourceCode commonlisp"><code class="sourceCode commonlisp"><span id="cb12-1"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb12-1" tabindex="-1"></a>(<span class="kw">defun</span><span class="fu"> efe/reading-mode </span>()</span>

  <title>My Top Album Picks For 2023</title>

<h1 class="title">My Top Album Picks For 2023</h1>
<p class="author"><a href="mailto:ismailefetop@gmail.com">ƒ∞smail Efe Top</a></p>
<p class="date">2024-01-18</p>
</header>
<p>
      2023 might be my busiest year yet. As a first-year in my major, I'm
      discovering a new city, giving tons of presentations, and balancing my
      relationships. As a result, I've had less time to discover and enjoy new
      music.
    </p>
<p>
      In spite of this I found lots of good record to listen to. Here are my top
      picks of 2023.
    </p>
<p><em>this listing is in no particular order.</em></p>
<h1 id="scaring-the-hoes">1. SCARING THE HOES</h1>
<div class="artwork">
<img alt="The artwork of Scaring the Hoes." class="artwork" src="scaring.png"/>
</div>
<div class="dogtag">
<p class="dogtag">Genre: Hip hop</p>
<p class="dogtag">Artists: JPEGMAFIA &amp; Danny Brown</p>
</div>
<p>
      Until the announcement of this album I've have never heard of Danny Brown.
      And honestly, I didn't care who he was, because I knew that if JPEGMAFIA
      was one of the co-artists of this project, it would be good. When the
      first song 'lean beef patty' came out, I knew I was right.
    </p>
<p>
      But I have to be honest, this album is not for everyone. It has a rough
      and dirty sound. Lots of beat switches and samples that are straight from
      a forgotten graveyard. But these are the exact reasons why I love this
      album so much. This album is your weird friend that always do niche movie
      references and that joke about internet memes. When done is dose, which
      SCARING THE HOES does, it feels like a different and fun thing.
    </p>
<h1 id="lets-start-here.">2. Let's Start Here.</h1>
<div class="artwork">
<img alt="The artwork of Let's start here." class="artwork" src="lets.jpeg"/>
</div>
<div class="dogtag">
<p class="dogtag">Genre: Psychedelic rock</p>
<p class="dogtag">Artists: Lil Yachty</p>
</div>
<p>
      I always knew Lil Yachty as a lighthearted rapper. So, when I heard that
      he had made a Psychedelic Rock album, I knew I had to check it out.
    </p>
<p>
      On my first listen, the Pink Floyd influence was pretty apparent but there
      was something different. His sound was fun, catchy and like how a
      Psychedelic Rock should be; it was <em>trippy</em>. And the album stayed
      that way, it was fresh every time I listened to it. That's why I spend the
      quarter of my year listening to this album.
    </p>
<h1 id="utopia">3. UTOPIA</h1>
<div class="artwork">
<img alt="The artwork of UTOPIA." class="artwork" src="utopia.png"/>
</div>
<div class="dogtag">
<p class="dogtag">Genre: Hip hop</p>
<p class="dogtag">Artists: Travis Scoot</p>
</div>
<p>
      Utopia is an album in which Travis Scott tries to return to his roots. It
      features raw cuts and a plethora of different voices.
    </p>
<p>
      This album was in the making for about 4 years. And you can tell this by
      how polished it is. Also, there are 52 beat switches in the album. So,
      every song feels like you are listening to an
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_play">EP</a>.
    </p>
<h1 id="latin-virgin">4. LATIN VIRGIN</h1>
<div class="artwork">
<img alt="The artwork of LATIN VIRGIN." class="artwork" src="latin.png"/>
</div>
<div class="dogtag">
<p class="dogtag">Genre: Hip hop</p>
<p class="dogtag">Artists: Alizade</p>
</div>
<p>
      This is a Turkish release, and one of my favorites. The reason why I love
      this album so much is that it's a big milestone for the Turkish rap scene.
      For a really long time the scene was populated by people who claim that
      woman weren't able to make good rap tracks and those few who made good rap
      tracks were people who were very conservative of their bodies. Alizade
      showed that you don't have to hide your body to make good rap song. While
      her songs lack in the lyrics department she more than makes up for it by
      using different types of sounds and colorful beats in her songs.
    </p>
<p>
      While she is still criticized in Turkey for showing off her body and not
      being a proper <em>'lyricist'</em>, I admire what she is bringing to the
      table in the Turkish rap scene.
    </p>
<h1 id="for-all-the-dogs">5. For All The Dogs</h1>
<div class="artwork">
<img alt="The artwork of For All The Dogs." class="artwork" src="dogs.png"/>
</div>
<div class="dogtag">
<p class="dogtag">Genre: Hip hop</p>
<p class="dogtag">Artists: Drake</p>
</div>
<p>
      I feel like Drake's albums are really a hit or miss. And luckily this
      album is a hit. While this album could cook a bit more, I like how raw it
      is. There are bunch of features I really like and it is a fun album.
    </p>
<p>
      He really needs to not take himself so seriously, he shines best when he
      has fun too.

  <title>My Favorite Themes</title>

<header id="title-block-header">
<h1 class="title">My Favorite Themes</h1>
<p class="author"><a href="mailto:ismailefetop@gmail.com">ƒ∞smail Efe Top</a></p>
<p class="date">2024-01-25</p>
</header>
<p>
      I use a lot of apps that allow me to use custom themes. While most people
      who are into customizing their setup like to choose one theme, I like
      different themes for different apps. Here are the themes I use.
    </p>
<h1 id="lighthaus">Lighthaus</h1>
<img alt="Image of Bear, my note-taking app." src="bear.png"/>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://lighthaustheme.com/">Lighthaus Website</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
      I use this theme for <a href="https://bear.app/">Bear</a>. It's real easy
      on the eyes and complements the bear font.
    </p>
<h1 id="mountain">Mountain</h1>
<img alt="Image of Kitty, my terminal emulator app." src="kitty.png"/>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/mountain-theme/Mountain">Mountain Repo</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
      This theme is used for the
      <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">kitty terminal</a>. I've been
      trying different themes for kitty for about 4 years. Mountain is by far
      the best.
    </p>
<h1 id="ros√©-pine">Ros√© Pine</h1>

      There are tons of options for
      <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">vs-code</a>. Ros√© Pine is really
      polished and looks great, nothing to complain.

      I saved the best for last, this is an Emacs theme inspired by the colors
      of the famous painting by Katsushika Hokusai. I really love this theme,
      the colors are perfect for reading and writing. It might not work this
      well for programming but luckily I don't use Emacs for that.
