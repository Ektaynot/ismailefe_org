First of all, this post is directly inspired by [[https://xenodium.com/my-emacs-eye-candy/][√Ålvaro's]] work. I love his stuff and he has been a great inspiration for me. I suggest everyone to check out his stuff.

In this post I am planning to walk you through my visual emacs setup, I will use the [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom Framework]]. There will be no explanation of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]] or [[https://orgmode.org][org-mode]]. Also, I won't go into how my inner emacs setup works as I intent to make a blog post about that.

*Let's Start*

* Installing Brew
I will be using [[https://brew.sh/][brew]] to install emacs and it's dependencies.

#+begin_src sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
#+end_src

* Installing Emacs
I choosing the default cask emacs. I tried several different forks of mac emacs but all of them gave me poor performance on my m2 macbook.

#+begin_src sh
brew install --cask emacs
#+end_src

*After installing do not start emacs.* Starting emacs will create an emacs profile, which will conflict with our doom profile.

* Installing Doom
Doom is a stable framework for emacs. You can considered like a base config file. It really makes emacs usable out-of-box.
#+begin_src sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs ~/.config/emacs
~/.config/emacs/bin/doom install
#+end_src
And now we are ready to hack our emacs.

* Changing the theme
I used to use the doom-dracula theme. But nowadays my favorite is the [[https://github.com/meritamen/emacs-kanagawa-theme][kanagawa theme]].

Add the below line to ~/.config/doom/package.el
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! kanagawa-theme)
#+end_src

Then set your theme to kanagawa
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq doom-theme 'kanagawa)
#+END_SRC

* Changing the font
I like using the [[https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/][JetBrains Mono]].

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "JetBrains Mono" :size 22))
#+END_SRC

* Enabling Word Count
This puts a word count in the modeline.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-modeline-enable-word-count t)
#+end_src

* Disabling hl-line-mode
'hl-line' makes the current line a different color. I don't like it.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(remove-hook 'doom-first-buffer-hook #'global-hl-line-mode)
#+end_src

* The title bar
I like the look of an empty unified title-bar, so this removes the text. *Only works for mac.*
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq ns-use-proxy-icon nil)
(setq frame-title-format nil)
#+end_src

* Removing the tilde signs
There is an ugly tilde sign on empty lines by default. I really don't like it. You can remove it by commenting out the 'vi-tilde-fringe' line in ~/.config/doom/init.el

* Olivetti mode
There is a melpa package called [[https://github.com/rnkn/olivetti][olivetti]]. This package provides a good look for writing/reading by decreasing the width of the buffer.

You can install Olivetti by adding the below line to ~/.config/doom/package.el
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! olivetti)
#+end_src

You can adjust the width like this
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq olivetti-body-width 94)
#+END_SRC

* Reading Mode
When writing or reading I like a couple of things different. I like to open up olivetti, disable the line numbers and the modeline. This function allows me to change these settings in one go. Also I have an undo function. I have them set to '√∂' and '√ß' as those keys are not used for any commands.

*Reading Function:*
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun efe/reading-mode ()
  "Toggle reading mode."
  (interactive)
  (hide-mode-line-mode +1)
  (olivetti-mode)
  (menu-bar--display-line-numbers-mode-none))
(global-set-key (kbd "C-√∂") 'efe/reading-mode)
#+end_src

*Undo Function:*
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun efe/undo-reading-mode ()
  "undo reading mode."
  (interactive)
  (hide-mode-line-mode -1)
  (setq olivetti-mode nil)
  (menu-bar--display-line-numbers-mode-absolute))
(global-set-key (kbd "C-√ß") 'efe/undo-reading-mode)
#+end_src

* Changing the Icon
Lastly, I like to use this [[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Emacs-logo.svg][logo]]. It is quite old but it suits my style.
