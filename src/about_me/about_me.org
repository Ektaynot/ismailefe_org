My name is ƒ∞smail Efe Top. I'm a first year Foreign Language Education student at [[https://www.metu.edu.tr/][METU]].

I like discovering new places, programming and hacking the programs I use. Some of my favorite programs are...

- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] for writing and reading.
- [[https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/][Kitty]] for terminal emulation.
- [[https://bear.app][Bear]] for taking short notes.
- [[https://www.zotero.org/][Zotero]] for collecting papers and making citations.
- [[https://arc.net/][Arc]] for web browsing.

Other than that, I am a proud owner of a [[https://happyhackingkb.com/][HHKB]], my favorite drink is Ice Caramel Latte, and my favorite place is the METU campus.
