<h1 class="title">My Top Album Picks For 2023</h1>
<p class="author">İsmail Efe Top</p>
<p class="date">2024-01-18</p>
</header>
<p>2023 might be my busiest year yet. As a first-year in my major, I'm
discovering a new city, giving tons of presentations, and balancing my
relationships. As a result, I've had less time to discover and enjoy new
music.</p>
<p>In spite of this I found lots of good record to listen to. Here are
my top picks of 2023.</p>
<p><em>this listing is in no particular order.</em></p>
<h1 id="scaring-the-hoes">1. SCARING THE HOES</h1>
<p>Until the announcement of this album I've have never heard of Danny
Brown. And honestly, I didn't care who he was, because I knew that if
JPEGMAFIA was one of the co-artists of this project, it would be good.
When the first song 'lean beef patty' came out, I knew I was right.</p>
<p>But I have to be honest, this album is not for everyone. It has a
rough and dirty sound. Lots of beat switches and samples that are
straight from a forgotten graveyard. But these are the exact reasons why
I love this album so much. This album is your weird friend that always
do niche movie references and that joke about internet memes. When done
is dose, which SCARING THE HOES does, it feels like a different and fun
thing.</p>
<h1 id="lets-start-here.">2. Let's Start Here.</h1>
<p>I always knew Lil Yachty as a lighthearted rapper. So, when I heard
that he had made a Psychedelic Rock album, I knew I had to check it
out.</p>
<p>On my first listen, the Pink Floyd influence was pretty apparent but
there was something different. His sound was fun, catchy and like how a
Psychedelic Rock should be; it was <em>trippy</em>. And the album stayed
that way, it was fresh every time I listened to it. That's why I spend
the quarter of my year listening to this album.</p>
<h1 id="utopia">3. UTOPIA</h1>
<p>Utopia is an album in which Travis Scott tries to return to his
roots. It features raw cuts and a plethora of different voices.</p>
<p>This album was in the making for about 4 years. And you can tell this
by how polished it is. Also, there are 52 beat switches in the album.
So, every song feels like you are listening to an <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_play">EP</a>.</p>
<h1 id="latin-virgin">4. LATIN VIRGIN</h1>
<p>This is a Turkish release, and one of my favorites. The reason why I
love this album so much is that it's a big milestone for the Turkish rap
scene. For a really long time the scene was populated by people who
claim that woman weren't able to make good rap tracks and those few who
made good rap tracks were people who were very conservative of their
bodies. Alizade showed that you don't have to hide your body to make
good rap song. While her songs lack in the lyrics department she more
than makes up for it by using different types of sounds and colorful
beats in her songs.</p>
<p>While she is still criticized in Turkey for showing off her body and
not being a proper <em>'lyricist'</em>, I admire what she is bringing to
the table in the Turkish rap scene.</p>
<h1 id="for-all-the-dogs">5. For All The Dogs</h1>
<p>I feel like Drake's albums are really a hit or miss. And luckily this
album is a hit. While this album could cook a bit more, I like how raw
it is. There are bunch of features I really like and it is a fun
album.</p>
<p>He really needs to not take himself so seriously, he shines best when
he has fun too.</p>
